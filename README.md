PizzaDash
====
This is a node.js application that "hacks" your Amazon Dash Button to order you a Domino's pizza!
I was inspired by [this article by Edward Bensen](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8).
I am using a few npm modules to listen for the button press and place the order: [RIAEvangelist](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist)'s [dominos](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-dominos-pizza-api) and also [hortinstein](https://github.com/hortinstein)'s [Node-Dash-Button](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button).

One idea would be to run this via a local server such as a Raspberry Pi and have on demand pizza ordering whenever you just need a pizza!
