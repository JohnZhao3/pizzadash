PizzaDash
====
This is a node.js application that "hacks" your Amazon Dash Button to order you a Domino's pizza!
I am using a few npm modules to listen for the button press and place the order: riaevangelist's ` pizzapi ` hortinstein's ` node-dash-button ` [Node-Dash-Button](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button). [See the pretty PizzaPI documentation](http://riaevangelist.github.io/node-dominos-pizza-api/)
